## Project 1: Just Got Married!

### Prompt

Do you want to know how challenging it was to get married last year during this
pandemic? Challenging to say the least. Forget picking the place for the wedding
ceremony, the venue for the wedding reception, and the food. The one thing they never
tell you is that the hardest part of the wedding planning is actually the guest list. Who
do you invite? Who do you say no too? How many people? Believe it or not, it’s a lot
of politics and family drama, if you’re not careful. So a word to the wise, which is to
remember that it’s your wedding. =]
To help me recreate this unfortunate act in the wedding planning, you will write the
implementation of the WeddingGuest class using a doubly linked list, which should be
sorted alphabetically according to last name, then first name. You will also implement a
couple of algorithms that operate on the WeddingGuest class.
